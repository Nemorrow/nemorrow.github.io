I am currently a PhD student at [School of CS, the University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/schools/school-of-computer-science.html) (USYD), under the supervision of Prof. Dacheng Tao. Before that, I received BEng from [SASEE, Beihang University](https://asee.buaa.edu.cn/) and MPhil in Computer Science from USYD in 2019 and 2022, respectively. My research interests include data-centric AI, knowledge extraction of large-scale datasets, and deep learning theory.
